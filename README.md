# customer_churn
The customer churn problem is a challenge faced by many businesses, particularly those with subscription-based business models or those that rely on repeat customers.

When a customer churns, it means that the company has lost a valuable source of revenue and potentially a long-term customer. High customer churn rates can be a sign of underlying issues such as poor customer service, unsatisfactory products or services, or increased competition in the market.

Reducing customer churn is important for businesses as it can help to improve revenue and profitability in the long run. To address the customer churn problem, companies often implement strategies such as improving customer service, offering loyalty programs, providing incentives for customers to stay, and conducting surveys to understand why customers are leaving.

By understanding the reasons for customer churn, companies can make targeted improvements to retain customers and ultimately improve their bottom line.
